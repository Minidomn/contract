# Minidomn

## Introduce

Minidomn is a launchpad for Web3-native investing DAOs.

Minidomn is a decentralized platform and network that enables investors and communities to create Web3-native investing DAOs. It also provides infrastructure and tools for investing DAOs to socially network, invest in real world and maintain compliance.

## How does it work ?

Minidomn is still in beta stage, so information is limited while the product is still under development. 

Common use cases include: ‍
1.Investment clubs: Pool USDC with friends to invest in different on-chain assets. This is like creating and running a venture fund with your friends. ‍
2.Individual SPVs: Pool USDC across your network to invest in a single asset, like a startup or an NFT. ‍
3.Legal legitimacy: For “real-world” investments that require having a legal entity, Minidomn makes it easy to connect your on-chain Minidomn to an LLC.
